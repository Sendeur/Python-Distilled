In REPL (read-eval-print loop) _ holds the result of the last operation.

Python source files are UTF-8 encoded text files.

Can have types associated to variables
    x: int = 10
however, they are ignored (can be checked by 3rd party tooling)...
    x: str = 10

A value is considered False if it is "False", None, numerically zero or empty. Otherwise, it's considered True.

Walrus operator (:=) can be used to assign to a variable. The result of the expression is the result of the RHS assignment.
    (x := 5 + 1) > 5    # True

Strings are stored as Unicode text.

Python's default arguments are evaluated once when the function is defined, not each time the function is called (like it is in say, Ruby).
This means that if you use a mutable default argument and mutate it, you will and have mutated that object for all future calls to the function as well.

__name__ contains the name of the enclosing module (see basic_module.py):
    * __main__, if script called in a top-level environment 
    * <script>, if script is imported via "import <script>"
